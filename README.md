You will be prompted to enter many things while running this program. First, you will need to enter the filename in which all of the data is stored. This format of the file should be tconst, titleType, primaryTitle, originalTitle, isAdult, startYear, endYear, runtimeMinutes, genres each separated by a tab. You are then prompted for the name of your log. You do not need to include ".log", as that will be added later. You will then be asked whether you want to add, update, delete, retrieve, or change the log. When searching, you are able to search for a full title or keywords, however, the full title is preferable. When searching for keywords, it will return the most popular movies with them due to the O(log n) runtime of the binary search tree which, by design, does not let you traverse leaves in different directions. When updating, if you try to chose a category that doesn't exist, you will have to reenter that you would like to update and then enter the correct thing. I hope you enjoy your time working with this program.
